        <blog-post class="blog-post">
            <p> Today was the day I recieved the devistating news. 
                I was told I was rejected for the job opportunity I was really hoping to get. 
                Yeah, it stung because of the amount of time it took
                and the amount of hope that was filling up in me every day. 
                Imagining the day that I can finally give in my two weeks notice to my current job, and finally
                start doing something I think I've always wanted. 
                But I blew it, however I learned a lot from my experiences interviewing with this company.
                Some key things was experience. And how much I lacked it. Sure I knew "things" about computers
                But I didn't <i>really</i> know computers. It sucked, but it was the truth. So I was handed a to do list
                of core topics I should get my hands on. The first one being creating a home lab. And the second a website to document the home lab.
            </p>
            <p> So here we are. Writing the first post of the website. Its exciting, and also daunting. But I like this news
                feeling I have. It had been a long while since I've been able to wake up and actually not get my mind off of it.
                I started with looking through my pile of dead laptops sitting in the cornor of my guest bedroom. (I told myself I would do 
                something about them one day. But there they sit to this day.)
                I had two worthy laptops, because they were the only two that worked out of the 8. 
                My old trusty Lenovo ThinkPad I recieved as a gift in college, and the old ACER chunk of silicon I inheritated from my brother.
                The Lenovo would be perfect as a Ubuntu Server, and eventually down the road I would like to play around with Windows Server on the ACER, so I put him aside. 
            </p>
            <p>The process was simple. Download the ISO Image file, find a spare flash drive lying around the house(not so simple) and boot up rufus to flash the image 
                onto the ThinkPad. Then into the installer I went. I followed the installation as best as I could, I've installed ubuntu countless times
                on different computers, I figured Ubuntu Server wouldn't be so different. And it wasn't. Until it came to connect it to the internet.
            </p>
            <p>No ethernet cord. And no helpful GUI to point, click, and enter my Wifi information into. I looked up tutorials on how to 
                connect an ubuntu server to a wifi, and I followed the instructions creating a YAML file and writing down everything letter for letter.
                Still no luck, indention error here, indention error there. God the indentations still haunt me to this day. And if it wasn't an indentation error
                it was something else. 
            </p>
            <p>Okay, so I might have jumped off the deep end and drowned. Time to get pulled out and try again with something more familure.
                Ubuntu Desktop. Long Term Support for Version 24? I can't remember off the top of my head. But I'm sure I'll edit it later. 
                Flashed a new image and booted up the installer. Followed the directions with the help of a lovely GUI, connected it to my home WIFI nextwork
                and started installing updates. Taking the small win, I added on top of it setting up local network drive sharing between my main windows computers
                and the ThinkPad. It wasn't easy, but I managed to share a folder with the two computers. After that I called it a day.
