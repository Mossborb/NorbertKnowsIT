			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hello, and thank you for checking out my website. 
				I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts from Lebanon Valley College
				back in 2020. The wonder years... And I had not found much work in my 
				degree. Whenever I did, it came with a lot of complications and frustration.
				So I've started looking for different career paths.
			</p>

			<p>At first I thought I wanted to do software engineering, because I loved to code
				and it felt natural to me. But everywhere I applied to required some sort of degree in Computer Science.
				No problem, I would just create a strong portfolio and share that with recruiters.
				Problem was, finding the right project, and motivating myself. So that path was essentially burnt out.
			</p>

			<p>Then came the idea of IT. People have told me its easy to get into, just find a help desk position and I'm in!
				Not so easy! So I need to expand my general knowledge in IT. Hence where this blog comes in. I hope to document my journey
				through IT using this website I've created. So far I have had success launching the website, unless... its curerntly down...
