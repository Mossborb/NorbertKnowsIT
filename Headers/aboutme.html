    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Norbert and I am teaching my self the ins and outs of IT, and 
        by the looks of it, website development as well. 
        I got interested in creating a website in order to document the process of starting from
        scratch, all the way to (hopefully) landing a job in IT.
